# Moving and Downloading Data

Below we'll show you some commands to download data onto your instance, or to move data between your computer and the cloud.

## Getting data from the cloud

There are two programs that will download data from a remote server to your local
(or remote) machine: ``wget`` and ``curl``. They were designed to do slightly different
tasks by default, so you'll need to give the programs somewhat different options to get
the same behaviour, but they are mostly interchangeable.

 - ``wget`` is short for "world wide web get", and it's basic function is to *download*
 web pages or data at a web address.

 - ``cURL`` is a pun, it is supposed to be read as "see URL", so its basic function is
 to *display* webpages or data at a web address.

Which one you need to use mostly depends on your operating system, as most computers will
only have one or the other installed by default.

Today we will use wget to download some data from Ensembl.

Before we can start our download, we need to know whether we're using ``curl`` or ``wget``.

To see which program you have, type:
 
```html
$ which curl
$ which wget
```


``which`` is a BASH program that looks through everything you have
installed, and tells you what folder it is installed to. If it can't
find the program you asked for, it returns nothing, i.e. gives you no
results.

On Mac OSX, you'll likely get the following output:


```html
$ which wget
```


```html
$ /usr/bin/wget
```

Once you know whether you have ``curl`` or ``wget``, use one of the
following commands to download the file:

```html
$ cd
$ wget ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/release-37/bacteria/species_EnsemblBacteria.txt
```

Let's see if the file from ensembl downloaded

```html
ls species_EnsemblBacteria.txt
```

it did!


### Uploading and Downloading Data to your Virtual Machine with scp - UNIX

This section is for your general knowledge.

`scp` stands for 'secure copy protocol', and is a widely used UNIX tool for moving files
between computers. The simplest way to use `scp` is to run it in your local terminal,
and use it to copy a single file:

```html
scp <file I want to move> <where I want to move it>
```

In terminal,you can use the `scp` command to upload a file (e.g. local_file.txt) to the cluster home directory:

```html
$  scp local_file.txt UserName@cluster.address:/scratch/
```

If you wanted to download data from your virtual machine, we would put the location of the folder within the virtual machine in the location of <file I want to move>

```html
$  scp UserName@cluster.address:/scratch/VirtualMachine_file.txt /home/margeno/MarineGenomics/week2/untrimmed_fastq/
```
